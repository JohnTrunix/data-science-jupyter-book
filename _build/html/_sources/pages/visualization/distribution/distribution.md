## Distribution Definiton

Statistical Distributions are an important tool in data science. A distribution helps us to understand a variable by giving us an idea of the values that the variable is most likely to obtain.

Besides, when knowing the distribution of a variable, we can do all sorts of probability calculations, to compute probabilities of certain situations occurring.
